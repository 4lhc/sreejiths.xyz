A balancing robot is a common demonstration of controls in a dynamic system. Due to the inherent instability of the equilibrium point, appropriate controllability and observability measures must be undertaken to stabilize the system about the desired equilibrium point.

In this project I designed and build a self balancing PID controlled robot using TIVA C Series Launchpad Evaluation Kit.

*Platform :* Tiva Development Kit EK-TM4C123GXL
