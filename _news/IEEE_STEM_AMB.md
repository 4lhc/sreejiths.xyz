title: Selected as IEEE STEM Ambassador
---

I am excited and elated to be selected as an IEEE STEM Ambassador. I am among the 40 IEEE STEM ambassadors selected globally this year. Feeling grateful and blessed by this great opportunity to represent IEEE Region 10 Pre-University STEM community.

I look forward to associating with IEEE STEM Ambassadors Gayathri Manikutty and Pranav Prabha from AMMACHI Labs, Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham and working on the IEEE TryEngineering "STEAM for Social Good" grant project.
