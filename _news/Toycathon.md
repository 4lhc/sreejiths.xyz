The winning toy robot, Haksh-E is an embodied social robot built by our AMMACHI Labs researchers and interns with AI models to interact with children through natural communications to engage in meaningful and beneficial interactions around hand hygiene. It has a human-like animated face rendered on an LCD screen. Its conversational AI enables the robot to understand, process, and respond in Hindi, English and Malayalam in a child like voice.

Haksh-E can have conversations on the topic of hand hygiene and handwashing, as well as limited non-linear conversations such as reciting rhymes and singing songs.

Toycathon, is an inter-ministerial initiative of the Indian government initiated by our Prime Minister, Shri. Narendra Modi, to challenge Indiaâ€™s innovative minds to conceptualize novel Toy and Games based on Bharatiya civilization, history, culture, mythology and ethos.
