title: Spotlight presentation at IROS 2021 Workshop on Robotics and the UN SDGs.
---

Our short paper on Haksh-E, the low-cost social robot to instill good
hand-hygiene in children, was selected for spotlight presentation at IROS 2021
Workshop on Robotics and the UN SDGs. This robot can supply valuable objective data to stakeholders and the UN to monitor
progress on targets for UN SDGs 3 and 6. We discuss the design parameters of Haksh-E and a pilot study conducted with 10 children between the ages 6-11 years hailing from
rural and urban locations in Southern India.
