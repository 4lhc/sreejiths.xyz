My primary research interests lie in long-term human-robot interaction (HRI) for positive behavioural change. More precisely, I would like to explore the underlying social mechanisms for long-term HRI with social robots as motivational agents and develop computational algorithms to implement these mechanisms. To that end, I envision a complementary union of model-based and data-driven HRI approaches. In addition, I intend to concentrate on deploying social robots in domains where long-term HRI can be beneficial. I strive to gain deeper insights to make both technically and socially relevant contributions towards building social robots.
My previous role was as a product designer and engineer with both software and hardware design experience. I was also the Director at _BASÆŽD_, a startup in Kerala, India, that focused on product design.

I am passionate about pre-university STEAM education. Currently, I serve as an IEEE STEM Champion (formerly STEM Ambassador) for IEEE region 10, and a Mentor of Change with Atal Innovation Mission, Niti Ayog, Govt. of India. In these roles, I conduct STEAM workshops and trainings for pre-university students.
